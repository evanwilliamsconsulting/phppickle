Welcome to PHPPickle!

This is working code to read a Python Pickle and return a useable PHP Array.

To activate the extension take the following steps:

1. Run PHPIZE to build the Makefile
2. make the extension
3. Install the extension
4. Test with the code in the html directory.

You may have to adjust your paths somewhat.  This will be fixed on a later release!
