Welcome to picklr!

This is almost-working code to read Python Pickles from the command line and return a useable JSON Array.

To activate the extension take the following steps:

This code exists in /src.  It doesn't yet quite work.

1. Run PHPIZE to build the Makefile
2. make the extension
3. Install the extension
4. Test with the code in the html directory.

You may have to adjust your paths somewhat.  This will be fixed on a later release!

In /picklr is the command line equivalent of phpzope.  
This is a good place to test pickles.

The 29 Pickles from a default Plone instance are in /pytest
